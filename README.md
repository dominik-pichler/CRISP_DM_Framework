The aim is to create a knowledge database around the CRISP (DM/ML(Q)) Framework, by setting up the CRISP Phases in Graph, so that each action becomes a node.
Eventually, best practies will be collected and added as further nodes to each action node.
This collection is planed to be executed both by asking industry experts for best practices, as well as scraping and analysing scientific papers.
